# weatherJournalApp
A repo to house the Weather Journal App from Udacity


# Description
Making this project was really fun despite me being really confused on what I had to.
But through being circumspect, I found out what I needed to do and how to do it. Also,
I really appreaciate my friends help in explaining how node.js and works and the concept
of web APIs. 


# Addons
I found most of the pieces of code I need on the Udacity tutorials so after Googling and asking my friends, I understood what specific pieces of code do and how it contributes to the program
